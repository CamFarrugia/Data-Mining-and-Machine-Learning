# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning
These are two of the projects done from my Data mining and machine learning class
The homework comes from the text book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning"
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani

Project 1 Final Chosen models is a document showing which type of model I chose after trying multiple options. The two datasets were a bit different so for the healthcare data set only used two predictors whereas the real estate data used all the predictors. The method was both the same using randomforest.

Project 1 uses the datasets Health and Real Estate.

Project 2 we were given a set of data that we knew nothing about and had to see if had high prediction power based on the varibles using Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA and KNN.

Project 2 uses the dataset classif1.
